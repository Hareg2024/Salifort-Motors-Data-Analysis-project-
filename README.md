## Salifort Motors Data Analysis project 

### 1 Providing data-driven suggestions for HR 
1.1 Description and deliverables 
This project is an opportunity for me to showcase my data analytics skills using Python skills. In this project, I analyzed a dataset and built predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. 
This project included an executive summary for external stakeholders and completed Python scripts and visuals. In this specific project, I used a regression model and a machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company (ethical considerations in place).

### 2 Project approach 
2.1 Plan 
2.1.1 Understand the business scenario and problem 
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. The company wants to have data-driven suggestions based on understanding of the data. They have the following question: What’s likely to make the employee leave the company? 

The goals of this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. 
If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company. 
2.1.2 Familiarizing with the HR dataset 
In the dataset, there are 14,999 rows, 10 columns, and these variables:
